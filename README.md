# CB Nest

**CB Nest** is a full-stack HR Management System built for hands-on learning. It covers real-world business workflows — employee lifecycle, attendance, leave approvals, payroll, ticketing, and more — using a modern stack (FastAPI + Next.js + Docker). Use it to understand how production-grade HRMS platforms work, and extend it with your own AI features.

## Overview

This project provides a working HRMS platform with authentication, employee operations, attendance, leave management, communication features, finance data views, and ticketing workflows.

It is designed as a practical base for AI feature integration (RAG, assistants, agent workflows) without rebuilding core HR modules from scratch.


## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async), Pydantic v2
- Database: SQLite
- Migrations: Alembic
- Orchestration: Docker Compose

## Features

- JWT auth with role-aware access (ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE)
- Employee directory with search, filters, and pagination
- Attendance clock in/clock out with status and mode tracking
- Leave balances and leave request workflow
- Announcements and polls
- Team calendar (leaves, WFH, holidays, birthdays)
- My Profile edits, profile photo upload, job history, documents
- Finance views (salary, statutory, payroll history)
- Tickets with assignment, status updates, onboarding tasks
- HR policy upload/download library
- Admin/Manager employee document upload flow (APPOINTMENT, TAX, PAYSLIP, OTHER)
- My Documents with search, view, and download; delete is allowed only for `OTHER` document type
- Password-protected PDF payslips (DOB in `DD-MM-YY`) for generated and uploaded payslips
- Notification bell for announcements, polls, ticket assignment, ticket status, leave decision, and employee-document uploads by others (not self-uploads)
- AI contract stubs (`/api/v1/chat/*`) returning `501` for future implementation

## Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine + Compose v2)
  - On Windows: install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and ensure the **WSL 2 backend** is enabled
- **Git**


## Quick Start

First-time setup:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd HRMS
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```


For PowerShell on Windows:

```powershell
Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Then run from repository root:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec api alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
docker-compose exec api python scripts/seed.py
```

Open:

- App: `http://localhost:3000`
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- API redoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

Verify everything is working:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

## Default Credentials

- Admin: `admin@mock-hrms.dev` / `password123`
- Manager: `manager@mock-hrms.dev` / `password123`
- Employee: `employee@mock-hrms.dev` / `password123`

## Configuration

Backend environment file: `backend/.env`

Use `backend/.env.example` as reference. Current key settings:

- `DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./storage/hrms.db`
- `APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata`
- JWT settings (`JWT_SECRET_KEY`, expiry values)

## Common Commands

Start services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Restart API + Web after code changes:

```bash
docker compose restart api web
```

Stop services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Run migrations:

```bash
docker-compose exec api alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
```

Reseed data:

```bash
docker-compose exec api python scripts/seed.py
```

Optional one-time migration (legacy payslip files to DOB-password-protected PDFs):

```bash
docker compose exec api python scripts/migrate_payslips_to_encrypted_pdf.py
```

Check containers:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

## Reset Database

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
docker-compose down
rm -f backend/storage/hrms.db
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec api alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
docker-compose exec api python scripts/seed.py
```

On PowerShell:

```powershell
docker-compose down
Remove-Item backend\storage\hrms.db -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose exec api alembic -c alembic.ini upgrade head
docker-compose exec api python scripts/seed.py
```

## API Notes

- API base path: `/api/v1`
- Health checks:
  - `/health`
  - `/api/v1/health`
- Standard response envelope:
  - Success: `{ "success": true, "data": ..., "error": null }`
  - Error: `{ "success": false, "data": null, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`
- Document uploads:
  - Employee self-upload: `POST /api/v1/employees/me/documents`
  - Employee self-delete: `DELETE /api/v1/employees/me/documents/{document_id}` (`OTHER` type only)
  - Admin/Manager upload for any employee: `POST /api/v1/employees/{employee_id}/documents`
  - Admin/Manager payslip upload: `POST /api/v1/employees/{employee_id}/documents/payslip`

## Troubleshooting

- If frontend shows stale build/runtime issues:
  - `docker-compose restart web`
- If API changes are not reflected:
  - `docker-compose restart api`
- If migration or seed fails:
  - reset DB using the commands above, then migrate and seed again
